# MMF License

Copyright (c) 2019-2023 Noah mshank

You may do whatever you want with the Mac Mouse Fix source code and other source 
files (from here on referred to as the "MMF Source"), with the following restrictions:

- If you publish any work derived from the MMF Source, you must make it apparent in 
  some way that it is derived from the MMF Source.
- If you have created an executable program (from here on called "Your Program") 
  compiled from some source code and/or other source files (from here on called 
  "Your Source"), and if Your Source includes files or source code copied or derived 
  from the MMF Source, then you may only publish Your Program under the following 
  conditions:
	- Your Program does not contain any malware or hidden malicious content.
	- You may not charge users money for Your Program, and Your Source must 
	  contain the monetization systems, including the licensing, trial period 
	  tracking, and payment system, present in the MMF Source without any 
	  alterations, and all of these systems must be active and working as intended in Your Program. 
	  That is unless Your Source features substantial improvements or 
	  additions to the MMF Source, such that Your Source should be considered 
	  its own, derivative work, separate from the MMF Source.

# Notes on the MMF License

The MMF License is a license that I wrote based on the MIT and DBAD licenses.
I designed it with 2 main goals in mind:

1. To prevent people with malicious intentions or who are just trying to make a quick 
   buck from publishing apps based on MMF. For example an app that looks like MMF but 
   contains malware, or an app that is just like MMF except that when you buy a license 
   someone other than me gets paid.
2. To allow everyone else who doesn't have malicious intentions to do anything they 
   like with the MMF source code, including reusing it in their own free and monetized 
   projects, or writing bug fixes and other improvements to Mac Mouse Fix and 
   publishing those. It should also allow someone to make some substantial improvement 
   to Mac Mouse Fix and to charge for this improved version or to release it for free.

I want the license to be Open Source in spirit but with some protections against bad actors, 
which I think might be important now that MMF is monetized. 
Also note that there are absolutetly no restrictions on how you use the source code, only 
on publishing apps compiled from the source code.

If you know something about copyright, I'd love to hear your feedback on whether 
the license as I formulated it fullfills these goals or how to improve it!

NOTE: The version-3 branch contains the KingIsulgard/iOS-Polynomial-Regression source 
      code licensed under GPL. GPL doesn't allow other licenses to be used. But the author gave me permission here https://github.com/KingIsulgard/iOS-Polynomial-Regression/issues/6.
