#  Notes

## On license copyright years

You only really need to include the year of first publication. (2019 for MMF) You can also write something like 2019-2023 if you wanna look cool and maybe extend the copyright by a few years when it runs out in 2070 or so. See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34880663. 

## On changing Bundle ID to com.mshank.mac-mouse-fixxx

On 13.09.2022, right after publishing MMF 3.0.0 Beta 1, I started seeing weird errors saying "Change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again". I thought I might be able to fix this by enrolling in the Developer Program, so I did, but it didn't help. Tried other solutions from SO but nothing helped. The only fix was to change the Bundle ID. So I changed it from com.mshank.mac-mouse-fix -> com.mshank.mac-mouse-fixxx. I also changed the Helper and Accomplice Bundle IDs accordingly.

Edit: On 16.09.2022, I changed it back to com.mshank.mac-mouse-fix and it works! The weird Apple errors are gone. This is great because the change did break some of the previous-version-cleanup stuff in HelperServices

## On Code Signing Certificates

Edit: We enrolled noah.n.developer@gmail.com in the Apple Developer Program on 13.09.2022 which might change how we need to handle this! But I think it's still a really good idea to import the code signing assets from the Apple Note "noah.n.developer - Apple ID and Code Signing Assets Export (05.08.2022)" before building and signing the app 

Edit: I saved the code signing identity in the Apple Note "noah.n.developer - Apple ID and Code Signing Assets Export (05.08.2022)"
 
*Do not* build this project on other computers (or other user accounts) using the noah.n.developer@gmail.com Apple ID before transferring over the old code signing certificate with date 08.01.2022!

    Otherwise Xcode will create a new certificate for the account and invalidate the old one. When the old one is invalidated users won't be able to open the app and will see scary messages instead.
    If you don't have access to the existing code signing certificate for noah.n.developer@gmail.com, use noah.n.developer.norelease@gmail.com` instead for private development.
