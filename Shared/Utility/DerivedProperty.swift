/// A derived property is a block that takes no arguments and returns a value when called
/// The returned value is calculated based on other property. So it's like a computed property
/// But here's the kicker: The block will only re-calculate its value if any of the properties it's based (aka "given properties")on have changed since the last invocation. Otherwise it will return a cached value
/// That way you can have computed properties that are only re-caculated when their result is expected to change, so that way you don't have to worry about efficiency!
///
/// We need to access the current values of the givenProperties whenever a derived property block is called. That' impossible with Swifts copy-on-write mechanics as far as I understand.
///     Edit: Actually I think I misunderstood.
///         In reality, even value types, when used in a closure, will see outside changes. So the value types will basically be references inside the block. Which is super confusing.
///         See: https://marcosantadev.com/capturing-values-swift-closures/
///         ... Well that just means that I might be able to use the Class-based implementation (see below) even on Value types, making the protocol extension obsolete.
///
///
/// I tried to make the derived property blocks store references to their base values. I could not find any way.
/// So we defined this as a protocol extension instead. That way we always have a reference to self available and can then get references to its current property values through keypaths.

/// Use this to create static derived properties. The protocol extension won't work with static properties.
/// Actually, this won't work with static properties, either, because keyPaths don't work for static properties ðŸ˜‘. At least the swift implementation. Maybe the ObjC implementation works with static properties. Edit: In createC, I had to change the `NSObject` typed values to `AnyObject` so I can pass in Type.self from Swift. But the string based keyValue coding still works on AnyType apparently (there are no compiler errors at least). Awesome! Remember to use #keyPath(). Edit2: But the lack of type saftey still makes it a little iffy to use createC. Maybe I should just use singletons and avoid static methods. Edit3: Ended up creating 2 functions from createC: `create_kvc` and `create_objc`

        /// Since we can only convert Swift keyPaths to string-based, kvc compatible keyPaths, and not the other way around, we might make this kvc compatible version of the create function the base implementation, and have the normal Swift version call it. Otherwise there'd have to be either a lot of code duplication or another layer of closure nesting / passing them as arguments making everything confusing.

The only way to get an immutable copy of a value in the closure is using capture lists on value types as far as I understood. (But what happens when the value types which are used in the closure are deallocated? For reference types you can control this using weak, strong, unowned in the capture list, but what about value types?)
///                     -> Something else we should make sure when calling this is to only capture self weakly in the `compute` closure, if we want to assgn the result of this function method call to a property of self. Otherwise that will be a strong ref cycle. Even though we already specified weak in the return closure. Ughh this is a lot.
        /// - Returns: A block which returns the derived property when invoked. The derived property can be invoked to retrieve its value. It will use a cached value if the `given` properties haven't changed since the last invocation.
        /// - Discussion: Derived property block holds a weak reference to self. So be careful passing the it around. It's intended to be assigned to a property of the caller.
        ///     If we pass in a reference type for S, we should use `weak`  to caputure it in the closure. Otherwise there'll likely be a reference cycle. But in order to use weak, we need to S to be a reference type (with  `AnyObject`).
