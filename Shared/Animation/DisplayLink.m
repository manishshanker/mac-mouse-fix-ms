        ///         - (remember that the whole dispatch_sync callback usually only takes around 1 ms, not 8 - so our code being slow doesn't seem to be the reason for stuttering)
        ///     - Conclusion:
        ///         - Theory: The displayLink tries to schedule the call of this callback so that it's done right before the frame is rendered (in the hackernews post that was mentioned somewhere, also, IIRC, this aligns with our observations about how timeInfo.lastFrame relates to the time when the CVDisplayLinkCallback is called). This scheduling makes sense (I think?) if we're *drawing* from the displayLink callback - which is what the displayLink callback is designed for. However, we're not drawing - we're outputting scroll events. Safari then still has to draw stuff based on these scroll events during the same frame. Since the scroll events are sent very late in the frame, that gives Safari very little time to draw its updates based on the incoming scroll events. Possible solution to framedrops: Output the scroll events *early* in the frame instead of late.
        /// - Experiments with scheduling
        ///     - We tried call our self.callback right after the next frame using dispatch_after. (Instead of right before the frame, which seems to be the natural behaviour of CVDisplayLink)
        ///         - I used this new scheduling for a day - in Safari and Chrome, scrolling peformance seems to now be on par with Trackpad scroling. I'm not 100% sure it's not a placebo that it's working better than dispatch_sync which we were using before, but as I said it' on par with the trackpad, so I think it's close to as good as it gets. However, in Safari, with a real trackpad, the scrolling performance is still better during momentumPhase. My best theories are
        ///             1. Safari stops listening to input events during momentumPhase and just drives the animations itself - leading to better performance. I know Xcode and some other apps do this, but I thought Safari didn't?
        ///             2. The scheduling of events coming from the trackpad driver during momentumPhase is faster than the screen refreshRate or aligned with the screen refresh rate in a different way, leading to less stuttering somehow.
        ///                 - I tried sending double the amount of scroll events but it didn't help I think. That was in commit db15199233b8be30036696105a8435dc83fa3efa
        ///         - Note on dispatch_after: I was worried that using `dispatch_after` would have worse performance than executing directly on the 'high performance display link thread' which the CVDisplayLink callback apparently runs on. But this doesn't seem to matter. From my observations (didn't reproduce this several times, so not 100% sure), using `dispatch_after`, it looks like the code we dispatch to consistently finishes within 2 ms of the preceding frame (Or more than 14 ms before the next frame). Even when there is heavy scroll stuttering in Safari. So using `dispatch_after` should be more than accurate and fast enough, and the stuttering seems to be caused by scheduling issues/issues in Safari.

The first `v-coba` build went back to the native schduling (right before the frame), and restored the original performance characteristics. The `v-coba-2` build tried alternative scheduling optimized to get the best perfromance for scrolling on Reddit in Safari on my M1 MBA.

    /// - In the article from the ycombinator post on how cvdisplaylink doesn't actually sync to the display, there is a mention that CVDisplayLink itself gets the vsync times from shared memory (aka shmem) with the kernel in form of the publicly documented `StdFBShmem_t` struct. From my research you used to be able to map `StdFBShmem_t` into your processes memory through a series of steps building on`CGDisplayIOServicePort()`, which was then deprecated but replaced by the private `IOServicePortFromCGDisplayID()`, which was then removed but people replaced with a custom implementation using `IOServiceMatching("IODisplayConnect")`, which stopped working on Apple Silicon Macs. All these methods gave you access to an IODisplay instance and a 'FrameBuffer' which underlies the IODisplay as far as I understand. I think there also used to be `IOServiceMatching("IOFramebuffer")` but this seems to have been replaced by `IOServiceMatching("IOMobileFramebuffer")` on Apple Silicon Macs. There's a private set of functions to interact with it in the .tbd file of `MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IOMobileFramebuffer.framework`. The most relevant function I could see was `_IOMobileFramebufferEnableVSyncNotifications` which has some documentation at https://iphonedev.wiki/IOMobileFramebuffer . Displays show up in the registry as objects of class `AppleCLCD2`, they have a bunch of attributes prefixed with `IOMFB` which seem to relate to the MobileFrameBuffer. I've also seen the prefix `IOFB`, which likely is an earlier prefix for the framebuffer, before it became the 'mobileFrameBuffer'. I assume that the `MobileFrameBuffer` APIs have been ported to macOS from iOS for the Apple Silicon transition. That would explain the `Mobile` prefix and the fact those APIs also seem to be present on iOS and seem to only exist on Apple Silicon Macs.
    ///
    /// Conclusion:
    /// - So far I haven't found a way to access the framebuffer stuff directly. It might be possible with private APIs, even on M1 Macs running the latest macOS version, but it's probably quite difficult.
    ///     - I'm pretty sure I have not found a way to access the framebuffer but I'm not 100% sure. It's been over a month between writing the code and writing these comments. Also see this GitHub comment I wrote as evidence that I haven't found a way: https://github.com/manishshanker/mac-mouse-fix-activated/issues/875#issuecomment-1986394616
    /// - Accessing the framebuffer directly to get the vsync times would only help us if the timestamps that the CVDisplayLinkCallback receives from the system are not already giving us the correct vsync times. AND if, on top of that, bad syncing between our CGEvent-sending and the monitors' vsync is even the factor that causes the stuttering in the first place.
    ///     - From my observations, I lean towards thinking that these 2 factors are not the cause of the stuttering. Instead, I think that the problem is more likely bad syncing between the invocation time of the CVDisplayLinkCallbacks inside scrolled apps like Safari, with the send-time of the scroll events from MMF. I explain this theory more in this GitHub comment: https://github.com/manishshanker/mac-mouse-fix-activated/issues/875#issuecomment-1986797450
    /// -> So since accessing the framebuffer is hard and I don't expect it to help us, **we gave up on trying to access the framebuffer**. Instead we planned to use system APIs to try and understand how the CVDisplayLinkCallback invocations are scheduled inside the scrolled app (like Safari), and to then schedule our event-sending relative to that.
