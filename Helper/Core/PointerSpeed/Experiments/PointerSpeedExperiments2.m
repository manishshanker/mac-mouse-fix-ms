         Test 11:
         Setting properties on the serviceClient just like CursorSense to get it to update it's internal state or something
         Mostly based on Test 4;
         Conclusion: It works!!!!!! I just need to set the mouse acceleration after setting the pointer resolution, and then both of them are actually applied  to the mouse !! Omg I'm literally so happy. I spent the last week trying to figure this out.*Ouffff of relief*
         The only things lef to figure out now are
         - What are these system default values for resetting? Can we somehow get the tracking speed which the user has set in System Preferences and translate and apply that to reset to the default?
            - pointer Res default: 400
            - acceleration default: com.apple.mouse.scaling in NSDefaults.
         - What range of values is sensible for letting the use choose, and how do we parametrize that stuff?
            - The default (unchangeable) pointerRes is 400. I think it makes sens to let the use choose between 0.5x to 2.0x of the original pointer res. The formula would be 400 * 1/(x). Actual values would range from 800 (lowest sens) to 200 (highest sens).
            - The HIDMouseAcceleration values settable on the driver  through System Prefs range from 0.0 to 3.0. IIRC that means it perfectly corresponds to the values settable through "defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling x". See Apple Note "Improve Pointer Acceleration" for acceleration values between 0.0 and 3.0 which I thought made sense as options.
         - How and when do we (re)apply the settings?
            - CursorSense reapplies the stuff when, logging in, when the computer wakes from sleep, when display configuration changes, etc. We should check if that's necessary and implement that stuff too, if yes.
         - How and when do we reset the values to the system default?
            - Whenever Mac Mouse Fix Helper quits should be fine. Maybe also when a mouse is detached, on the driver of that mouse. When MMF quits we'd have to iterate through all attached mice and reset them individually. This would all be easier if we set the pointerRes and acceleration on the eventSystemClient instead of the individual mouse drivers. But that might also be less robust because if MMF crashes then the settings would be stuck and be applied even on newly attached mice. Idk until when. Maybe until next restart or maybe until forever? I should do more testing there.
         
         
         Edit: Actually we had CursorSense enabled during these last few tests so we need to test this stuff again.
            -> It still works! Setting the acceleration is also still necessary to make setting the pointerResolution work. So having CursorSense enabled doesn't seem to have influenced the tests (somehow - from my understanding of the disassembly it should have because it listens to property changes in the eventSystemClient and re-applies it's settings if it detects them IIRC)
