Sol 2 uses transforms and is a little faster, but it still seems to call autolayout stuff for some reason. Update late 2023: We did some more stuff to turn off autolayout/constraints stuff, and then we tested sol 1 and sol 2 again, and now sol 1 is faster. However we also found that there might be some randomness factor in our testing (See https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/743378?answerId=775077022#775077022) so our tests aren't really conclusive. So sol 1 seems to use less CPU now, however, sol 1 seems to introduce some input lag, so we're going with sol 2 still.
