/// We've created this so that we don't have to use the main runLoop for all eventTaps
///     The main runLoop works fine but I suspect that it might cause higher CPU use to put all eventTap onto the main runLoop
///     Specifically I'm trying to get the CPU usage for twoFingerModifiedDrag lower
///     Edit: This does decrease CPU use! But only slightly.
