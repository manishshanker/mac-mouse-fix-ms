In that case we show the user prettty long instructions which involve following a link. Toasts were too "transient" for this, because they automatically disappear. So we designed this as a "persistent" alternative to a toast.
    ///
    /// This is EXTREMELY OVERENGINEERED for this one, extremely rare use case.

    /// To justify this madness we could:
    ///
    /// 1. Transition other Toasts which (show instructions / would benefit from being persistent) to using this method.
    ///     - I can only think of the toast that shows when MMF is disabled in System Settings since it also has instructions
    /// 2. Transition other uses of NSAlert to abstractions like this one.
    ///     - The only thing this implementation has over normal NSAlerts is that its body is markdown-capable. This might be nice for the "Send Me an Email" alert.
    /// 3. Make this implementation totally custom and not dependent on NSAlert
    ///     - I don't like that NSAlert forces an image and a title. Having just an AttributedString like the toasts would be cleaner. But I guess this is good enough and the visuals will update if Apple updates NSAlert.
    ///
    /// Notes:
    /// - This is currently untested, but also unused pre-Ventura
    /// - Update: We're using this for checkHelperStrangenessReact() since a year now. Currently we're on macOS 14.2. It seems to be working well! I also don't see how it's so overengineered? I guess because the enabling issues turned out to be pretty common. I get several reports a week about it currently, despite the fact that this alert should come up in most situations where registering the helper with SMAppService fails.
