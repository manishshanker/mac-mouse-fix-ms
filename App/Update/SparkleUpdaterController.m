    /// - 2. When the user chooses "Check for Updates..." from the Menu Bar
    ///     - Why: This is the behavior that Sparkles expects. If our `bestValidUpdateInAppcast:` method then decides that we don't want to show any update to the user (by returning an update that has a lower build number than the user's current build number), Sparkles then shows a popup saying `<bestValidUpdateInAppcast> is the latest available version`. So to make this Sparkle popup say the truth, we need to remove the skipped versions (And theoretically any other filters we apply to the appCast). We could also make the Sparkle popup say the truth by somehow ignoring skipped versions during those user-initiated checks. But not sure how that would be easily possible. And I like the current behavior

    /// Custom logic:
    
    /// - 0. If the user skips a major update, that is recorded separately from when the user skips a minor update. (2.0 -> 3.0 is a major update, and 2.2 -> 2.3 is a minor update.)
    ///     -> This allows users to stay on their current major version, and still receive minor updates.
    ///     -> Sparkle 2 has a similar feature built in I think (They have a `SUSkippedMajorVersionKey`). We sort of re-implemented this here on Sparkle 1. Seemed easier and less risky to reimplement it instead of upgrading to Sparkle 2, but I'm not sure.
    /// - 1. For minor updates, we present the user with the newest available update (standard)
    /// - 2. but for major updates, we always present the user with the *oldest* available major update
    ///     - That's so the user sees the x.0.0 update notes with all the major changes.
    ///     - This is especially nice, if the new major version is a paid update, but it's always kind of nice to give the user an intro to the new major version I think.
    ///     - This also makes it so the user only has to skip one major update to stay on the current major version. E.g. if you're on 2.2.1, the only major update you will ever be presented with is 3.0.0 - the oldest major update. If you then skip 3.0.0, you won't see any other major updates, such as 3.0.2, or 4.0.0.
    ///     - A side effect of this is that we don't ever jump over major versions. If we're on 0.9, we will be presented with 1.0 next. Then if we're on 1.0, we'll be presented with 2.0 next. We don't skip past major versions.
    ///         - This might be very useful in a case where the 3.0.0 update notes explain that MMF 3+ are monetized, but the MMF 4 update notes don't re-explain that MMF 3+ are monetized. If we don't allow MMF 2 users to go straight to MMF 4, they won't be able to miss the info that MMF 3+ are monetized.
    /// - 3. xxx If there's a free update, we prioritize that.
    ///     - E.g. MMF 2.2.5 -> 2.2.6 will be presented over 2.2.5 -> 3.0.0 --- because MMF 2 -> MMF 3 is a paid update.
    ///     -> We removed this, because the features we implemented so users can stay on the current major version and still receive updates, solve the same issue as this I think.
    ///     - Note from old implementation: I think it's better without this, since even without this, the user will be prompted to update to next major version. And if they skip it, they will instead see minor version updates. That's good enough and consistent, and we won't have to have some up-to-date database about which updates are free/paid.

    /// - As far as I understand, the `appcast` arg is already prefiltered by Sparkle using stuff like skippedUpdates, minimumAutoupdateVersion and minimumOSVersion.
    ///   Also, as far as I understand, the default implementation of this method simply uses [delegate versionComparator] (which defaults to a `SUStandardVersionComparator`) to get the appCast item with the highest version.
    ///     - I base these assumptions the following Sparkle 2 source code (we're using Sparkle 1.26.0 at the time of writing, but I hope nothing drastic changed): https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2247105ff37ba7b317e65af9833ecbb0f67f81de/Sparkle/SUAppcastDriver.m#L230
    ///     - **Update**: Things do seem to be different that what I assumed: The `appcast` arg is not prefiltered. Instead it seems like the SUAppCastItem *returned* by this method is checked by Sparkle against skippedUpdates, minimumAutoupdateVersion, etc.  to decide whether to actually present it.
    /// - Tip for testing: You can test this pretty well by just changing the build number and version in Xcode and then building the app and seeing which updates it shows you.
    ///
    /// Random/not important:
    /// - It might be slightly nice to delete the users' choice about skipping major versions when a new major version of the app is launched for the first time.
    ///     - Otherwise, there could be some slighlyyy inconsistent behavior where: You're on 2.0.0. You skip the 2.2.3 minor update. Then you update to 3.0.0, and then you skip the 3.0.2 minor update. Then you downgrade to 2.0.0. Your choice about skipping the 2.2.3 update has been deleted, and you're presented with 2.2.3 update a second time. This isn't bad in itself. But here's the inconsistency: If you didn't skip any minor updates while you were on MMF 3, then your choice about skipping the 2.2.3 update wouldn't have been deleted, and you wouldn't have been presented the 2.2.3 update a second time after downgrading to MMF 2.0.0. That's sort of strange. But I don't think it matters.
    ///     - 'Fixing' this this would require us to introduce a new `launchesOfCurrentMajorVersion` variable in AppDelegate, analogous to the `launchesOfCurrentBundleVersion` variable. But I don't think it's worth it.
    /// - The original design for our`bestValidUpdateInAppcast:` logic (which I more or less outlined [here](https://github.com/manishshanker/mac-mouse-fix-activated/issues/962#issuecomment-2120238813) and which was implemented in older commits) was implemented in a more complicated way, but should behave mostly the same. The problems that made me think of this new solution, and which this new solution fixes is this:
    ///     1. In the old implementation, if you skipped a minor version, and then downgraded to a previous major version, you would't receive any minor updates. That's because if you skipped a minor update, all updates with a lower build number would not be presented to the user anymore.
    ///     2. If you skipped a major update, and then manually downloaded a new major version, then that new major version also wouldn't present any major updates to itself to the user. That's because we only used to store a piece of state saying userDidSkipAMajorUpdate, with no way to differentiate, which major update was skipped.
